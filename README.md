# Twitter Bot Usage Guide

This guide will show you how to use the Twitter bot that posts the message "Today is day [day of the week]" on a daily basis.

## Prerequisites

- You will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- You will need to have the `tweepy` and `datetime` libraries installed. You can install these libraries using `pip`, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install tweepy
pip install datetime
```

- You will need to have a Twitter developer account and create a new app. This will allow you to access the Twitter API and use it to automate your bot. Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) to set up your developer account and create a new app.

## Setup

1. Copy the code from the previous answer into a file called `twitter_bot.py`.
2. Replace `YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY`, `YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` with your own API key, API secret, access token, and access token secret that you obtained when you created your Twitter app.

## Running the Bot

To run the bot, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where `twitter_bot.py` is saved. Then, run the following command:

```bash
python twitter_bot.py
```


The bot will post the message "Today is day [day of the week]" to Twitter.

To run the bot on a daily basis, you will need to set up a schedule using a service like cron or the `time` library. For example, you can use the `time` library to run the bot every 24 hours like this:

```python
import time

while True:
  post_tweet()
  time.sleep(86400)  # Sleep for 86400 seconds (24 hours)
```
